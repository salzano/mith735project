  <p>Below is Angela Peoples's op-ed, first published on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/opinion/sunday/black-women-leadership.html"><i>The New York Times.</i></a></p>
  <p>Because her image is the central text analyzed in this project, I think that this makes sense as a document to have on this webpage? But I'm not sure it'll be primary for my research except for maybe being a node in the network that I could trace.</p>
  <p>I attempted to complete this TEI as a "more polished" prototype -- to the best of my abilities. I chose to code persName with race-gender tags because I'm specifically interested in arguments about white women and white feminism. This is tagged in the Wortham article, as well.</p>
