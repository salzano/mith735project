  <h2> My plans with this map </h2>
  <p>I don't plan to use this map in my project.</p>
  <p>Becuase my project is going to rely on visualizations, I think geographical maps will distract from the purpose of the project.</p>
  <p>Maps like this could be itneresting for this project if I wanted to know how local argument cultures were influenced by the spread of the Peoples image.
  Since I'm more interested in the theoretical ideas about post-humanism and rhetorical ecology, I don't think this is a good direction for my proposal.  </p>
