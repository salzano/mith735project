<p>I made three design prototypes using two approaches, TEI and mapping. In this short narrative reflection, I want to review each approach and my understanding about how I think it will relate to my project. I want to conclude by suggesting what approaches I would like to learn in the future, were I to complete this project. </p>
<h2>Mapping</h2>
<p>The first prototype I attempted was a map of <a href="https://salzano.github.io/mith735project/map1/">2017 Women’s March protests around the United States</a>. I used Google maps ‘my maps’ to create the map, and I hand-input data from Wikipedia. This allows for easy placing of geo-located bubbles onto a map that can be readily manipulated by the user. (It does not seem possible for the creator/researcher to limit the scale of the map.) It necessarily focuses on the map, where a user can then click to reveal more information. You cannot see content of each bubble besides the bubble itself, which can be modified to one of google’s various bubble options. </p>
<p>If I were to do a project with lots of <i>local</i> data—that is, data about specific women’s march protests that also had metadata about where it was made/tweeted—this would be a really interesting approach. I could imagine a map+gephi combo where a sort of geo-ecology was built to visualize how rhetorics moved across locations. This would only be limited by the inability to use this specific method of mapping to display much content besides bubbles. However, since I don’t wish to make claims about location as much as I want to make claims about meaning making across dimensions of race/racism. In order to do this, I decided to create two TEI documents. </p>
<h2>TEI</h2>
<p>I created two TEI documents. The first, <a href="https://salzano.github.io/mith735project/mytei/">Peoples TEI</a>, is my more polished one. The second, <a href="https://salzano.github.io/mith735project/mytei2/">Wortham TEI</a>, is the less polished one. TEI is also free to use, since I was hand-coding. I find it a bit clunky to use because I am so used to WYSIWYG editors that would have some GUI for tagging/annotating. However, it allows for a researcher to tag an original document with a shared code such that other researchers or machines could read the text later. This allows, for example, a researcher to write CSS or plug TEI into programs such that one can highlight certain words/phrases or place locations on a map. </p>
<p>If I end up using data in my project besides tweets, I think that TEI could be very useful. It might provide a way for me to meaningfully search through different media. However, I also think that the annotations of these original documents is not so useful because it is such a laborious process that doesn’t really produce the visualization I’m interested in. </p>
<h2>Future directions</h2>
<p>TEI and Mapping were useful exercises that proved to be questionably-tangentially, if at all, useful for the project I envision. In the future, I would like to learn more about mapping and Gephi. I was familiar with google fusion tables, but since that is being phased out, I would like to better learn Gephi. I think the time (+ funds to create that time) to understand this software would be incredibly beneficial to this project. In addition, I think I need to better learn how I would gather tweets and put them in Gephi in order to know if TEI or mapping could be useful. </p>
