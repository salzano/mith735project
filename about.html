  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Matthew Salzano advocates for and examines the role of intellectuals in public culture.
    As a scholar, Matthew studies rhetorical theory, digital humanities, and deliberation.
    He is a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication at the University of Maryland, where he teaches courses in public speaking and rhetorical criticism.
    He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degrees in communication studies and women’s and gender studies at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington.
    Matthew currently investigates how feminist intellectuals intervene in public culture.
    He has written about protestors at the Women’s March, bell hooks’s criticism of Beyoncé’s <i>Lemonade</i>, and YouTuber ContraPoints’s video essays about the alt-right.
    When crafting his own interventions, Matthew has worked as a Twitter bot-creator, video producer, and journalist.
