  <p>Below is Jenna Wortham's op-ed, first published on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/who-didnt-go-to-the-womens-march-matters-more-than-who-did.html"><i>The New York Times.</i></a></p>
  <p>I imagine that, if I find a way to use the Peoples TEI in a way that is useful for this project, this rough TEI could be expanded and improved usefully.</p>
  <p>This is an incomplete annotation that only noted 'persname type="race-gender"' because that is a comparison I wanted to highlight. Future versions would be annotated to make machine reading easier for a variety of analyses.</p>
