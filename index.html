  <h1>Matthew Salzano's MITH 735 site</h1>
  <p>On this page, you'll find all the assignments completed for my MITH 735 course, taken at the University of Maryland, College Park, in Fall 2019.</p>
  <p>This website may become a full project in the future!</p>

  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <h3>Assignment 1: <a href="https://salzano.github.io/mith735project/disparticipation/">Research Proposal</a></h3>
  <p>First, I completed a research proposal briefly outlining the research project. The proposal addresses the plan of work, the reserach areas implicated, the data that would be collected, and the presentation of the research project. </p>
  <h3>Assignment 2: <a href="https://salzano.github.io/mith735project/scan/">Environmental Scan</a></h3>
  <p>Second, I completed an environmental scan that engages more deeply into the rhetoric and DH literature to suggest how my project would contribute. This scan provides the most complete vision of the project, including similar projects as examples.</p>
  <h3>Assignment 3: Prototypes</h3>
  <p>Third, I completed a series of protoypes to begin experimenting with the project. The reflection details why I chose to make 2 TEIs and 1 map. My wireframe shows what I imagine the final research website looking like. I also included metadata to show the logisitics of project management.</p>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Assignment 4: Grant proposal</h3>
<p>Finally, I completed a draft grant proposal to suggest how much the project proposed in the research proposal and environmental scan would complete. I envision the project taking place over a summer, where I would be funded as the PI and I would fund several MITH staffers to help with project development (a la AADHum scholars).</p>

    <li>The environmental scan and research proposal were both edited to reflect the progress of the project.</li>
