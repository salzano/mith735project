  <h2> My plans with this metadata </h2>
  <p>This metadata shows the multiple working parts of the project. To use <a href="https://archive.org/details/howdidtheymakethat">Miriam Posner's handy phrase</a>, it helps me reveal "sources, processed and presented" in a meaningful fashion for starting and maintaining production of this project. </p>
  <p>In this case, my sources are in row 2. My process is in row 3. and my presentaiton is in rows 1, 4, and 5.</p>
  <p>Were this project to be funded, I would be able to show our process on the project using these categories in this metadata.</p>
